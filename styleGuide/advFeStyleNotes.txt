#How to lock eveything inline
use a html table and not a div

  <!-- I had board.State throwing a file now found error and parse syntax error -->
  <!-- When calling a function there is no need to put board state in quotes -->

#Centering the Board in the middle of the page
Parent position relative, target, position abosoute, Top 50%, Translate Y 50%, margin 0 auto

#Place the Buttons under the board, center it 
-Add it to the div under the board;
-text align center, actually centers the control panels with buttons

#Set the Start Buttons next to each other, on the drop down
-span Stack is not working
*We should just try using, dipslay inlineblock, this here does not work

        <div class="controlPanel">
            <div class="dropdown">
              <button id="start" class="btn btn-primary dropdown-toggle" type="button" data-toggle="dropdown" ng-disabled="!boardLock"> Start Game
              <span class="caret"></span></button>

                  <li>

              <button id="reset" ng-click="resetBoard()">Restart Game</button>

Maybe because they were in different div's how about place the buttons right next to 
each other, this works
            <div class="dropdown">
              <button id="start" class="btn btn-primary dropdown-toggle" type="button" data-toggle="dropdown" ng-disabled="!boardLock"> Start Game
              <span class="caret"></span></button>
                <button id="reset" ng-click="resetBoard()">Restart Game</button>
                <ul class="dropdown-menu">
                  <li>
                    <span><button ng-click="startPlayer()">You Move First</button></span> 
                    <span><button ng-click="startCPU()">Computer Moves First</button></span>
                  </li>
                </ul>

#Align text ontop of a floating div, just center it in general
-I just but the game prompt within gameBoard which text-align is centered
-text align center in the body

#create some space between the button panel and the game board
-margin-top or padding top on the button panel

#Have a centered floating block, with shorter border on each side
.gamePrompt {
  border: 1px solid;
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: 35%;
}

There seems to be extra white space on the block
<!-- Simon Game Styling -->

#Center the game shell 
1. wrapper-position relative, height 100vh, width 100%, 
2. gameBoard-position absolute, top 50%, left 50%, transform: translate(-50%, -50%)

#Get the buttons oriented correctly
-The rows are crunched into columns as opposed to rows
*When I removed display: inline-block, this all changed
*Maybe I should separate by breaks?
*Split up the divs into top, center, and buttom? and inline block,
it does not work
*The inline block should be cast to the objects directly and not the 
parent which would go to the children

**My issue at the end of the day i think was div class wrapped within a span class
the splan class does not cover the button for some reason

#How to hav multiple rows of items on top of each other
-set the parent row=class, as table 
-set the parent children of that row as table-cell
-Start centering the elements 

*An error that I am facing is that one row is above another row, not sure how to deal with that
  -An error was that my div Id's were spelled wrong so the styles were not being applied to them

  #How to center an element in its respective row
    -I was able to center the top and bottom row buttons with margin: 0 auto, but the mid row elements have not moved yet-

  #For some reason Top and bottom rows were defined, but my midRow was note defined/squished into the 3rd row
   This was because, i did not give a width to the mid row

-use table Rows to create horizontal rows
-User table cells, <td> to create columns, how to hortizontally, side to side shift table items?
-One should actually try to add an extra cell, next to it in the row and it will actually move it to the 
-center!


The Row might actually work for signle objects, or 2 with float but with more objects it becomes much more complicated

#I was able to center the table with 
margin: 0 auto; applied directly to the tableId

#How to add spacing between the buttons
button {
  margin: 2px;
}

Margin is outside space and padding is inside space

#Indictate Strict mode or not
-May just print the true or false to the screen
